# Stock Market Prediction using LSTM and CNN

Welcome to the repository for my AI project focused on stock market prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architectures!

## Overview

This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to analyze historical stock market data and predict the difference in stock prices. By combining LSTM and CNN architectures, along with meticulous feature engineering and selection, we aim to achieve accurate predictions that can empower investors and traders with actionable insights.

## Features

- Utilizes data fetched from Yahoo Finance for analysis.
- Implements LSTM and CNN architectures for predictive modeling.
- Includes feature engineering and selection techniques to capture market trends effectively.
- Predicts the difference between closing and opening prices of stocks.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/An1k4et/LSTM-CNN.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd LSTM-CNN`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset or utilize the provided sample data.
2. Run the main script: `python LSTMCNN.py`
3. Analyze the results and predictions.
